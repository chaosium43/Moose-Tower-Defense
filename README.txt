KNOWN BUGS:
Sometimes, the 4-0 Fire Tower upgrade's laser doesn't disappear at the end of a round. Not sure why that happens.
Also, there seems to be lag when you start a new game after one has already been played. I'm guessing
that's due to some sort of memory leak but I'm not sure about that either as I call the Java garbage collector
every time a new game is started.
